# 💫 About Me

Hi! I'm **Kader Sutlu**, a Computer Engineering graduate from **Kırşehir Ahi Evran University**, class of February 2024. During my university years, despite the challenges of remote learning caused by the pandemic and earthquakes, I stayed focused on improving myself in the software field.

I participated in several **bootcamps**, completed **voluntary internships**, and worked on real-life projects to gain hands-on experience. Over time, I developed a strong interest in **Android development**. For the past **1.5 years**, I've been actively working in this field, including an **8-month internship** as an Android developer. Currently, I'm learning **Jetpack Compose** and working on **three Android projects**.

At the same time, I work as an **ICT teacher** at a vocational high school, where I find great value in sharing knowledge with others. Still, my main goal is to begin my professional journey as a software developer and I'm actively seeking the right opportunity.

📌 I'm a motivated and adaptable developer, always eager to learn and grow.  
🌍 I'm currently taking an English course to build a strong foundation, and my current level is **A2**.
